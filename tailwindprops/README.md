# React + Tailwind CSS Personal Card Project

This project is a beginner-level React application built from my own idea to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals. It implements a simple personal information card, with Tailwind CSS used as a supporting tool for styling. The primary focus of this project is React, and it serves as an initial step toward building more projects to deepen my understanding of React development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** ⚛️: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
