# 🔐 React Password Generator

This project is a **Password Generator application** developed to strengthen my understanding of **core React concepts** and modern frontend development practices.  
It focuses on building a **state-driven, interactive user interface** using React Hooks, while leveraging **Tailwind CSS** to create a clean, responsive, and visually engaging design.  
Through this project, I explored practical implementations of component logic, controlled inputs, performance optimization, and real-time UI updates—making it a valuable step in my **React learning journey**.
